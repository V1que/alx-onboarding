This is an algorithm that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order
1. Start
2. Read in three numbers from user (n1, n2, n3)
3. if n1<n2 then goto step 4 else go to step 8
4. if n1<n3 goto step 5 else go to step 7
5. if n2<n3 then goto step 9 else goto step 6
6. interchange n2 and n3 and goto step 9
7. interchange n1 and n3 and goto step 3
8. interchange n1 and n2 and goto step 3
9. return print (n1, n2 ,n3 )
